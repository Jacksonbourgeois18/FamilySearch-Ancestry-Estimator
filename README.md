# FamilySearch-Ancestry-Estimator
Use FamilySearch tree to estimate your ancestry

This program requires a mostly-complete family tree on familysearch.org. It works by pulling all of ancestors for ten generations from that tree and assigning admixture based on their position on the tree and the probable origin of their surnames.

Headers for the requests are specific to each user. I used Insomnia to obtain them. The tool is somewhat limited for certain users. Those with significant amount of Spanish, Portuguese, or Latin American ancestry, for instance, will see small amounts of admixture from many different Spanish/Portuguese speaking countries. See example below.
